### Useful resources

- [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - This helped to remind me how to use certain CSS tools, specifically the shorthands for padding and margins.
- [W3 School](https://www.w3schools.com/) - This helped to remind me of the value placement for the margin and padding shorthands.
